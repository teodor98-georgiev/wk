#11 Traffic Light Simulator: Write a program that simulates a traffic light. The user inputs a color (red, yellow, green),
#  and the program tells what action to take ("stop", "ready", "go").

# def light_action(light):
#     if light == "red":
#         print("stop")
#     elif light == "yellow":
#         print("ready??") 
#     elif light == "green":
#         print("go!")
#     else:
#         print("light is broken, turn around!")

# entering = (input("enter the light:"))
# light_action(entering)   # instead of stopping must continue with asking continuosly input to the user

# ZDR add while
